TODO:
	- Allow options --rows=<int>, --cols=<int> to indicate the size of the
	  world.
	- Create ncurses display.
	- Optimisation: Eliminate if's in calculating the sum... rather have
	  several for loops that each know what to do (without asking
	  questions).
	- Allow file (--init=<file>) to be specified in the input, in a certain
	  format.
	  
	  Example (the blinker):

	  5 5
	  0 0 0 0 0	The first two numbers indicate the rows (R) and columns
	  0 0 0 0 0	(C) respectively. Then should follow R lines of C
	  0 1 1 1 0	integers (0s or 1s), separated by spaces. Zero (0) means
	  0 0 0 0 0	"dead" and one (1) "alive". This makes up the initial
	  0 0 0 0 0	configuration.

	  Here's another example (the beacon):

	  4 4
	  1 1 0 0
	  1 0 0 0
	  0 0 0 1
	  0 0 1 1

DONE:
	- Allow option --interval=<int> that sets the interval times.
	- for every "timeslice", initialise a new array and fill it based on the
	  values of the old array, then replace the old array.
